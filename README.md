# Binary Trees ‚ùó‚ùó

- ### Hacktober Fest üî•üî•
    We hereby welcome coders who wish to contribute to Open Source and participate in  Hacktober Fest 2020.  
    We are looking for <b>Quality</b> and <b>not Quantity</b> 

- ### About the Repository  
    This repository aims at providing solutions to the famous questions on Binary Trees in as many languages as possible.  
    You can get good questions on Binary Trees from sites like  
        1. <a href = "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/">GeekForGeeks</a>  
        2. <a href = "https://www.interviewbit.com/">InterviewBit</a>

- ### Guidelines for Contribution
    1. **Fork** the Repository
    2. **Add, edit or enhance** code in whichever Language you want
    3. If a language folder isn't present in the repository, **feel free to add** it.
    4. All codes must be **Binary Tree centric**. As the name of the repository suggests, this repository is made especially for Binary Trees.
    5. **No duplication, repitition and spamming**. It will not lead to an accepted Pull Request.
    6. Once you are done with your contribution, **issue a PULL REQUEST**. The Maintainers may ask you for a few changes. Once everything seems good, your code will be pulled and added to the original Repository branch.
    
- ### No Duplication
    If a language folder, say C++, already has a code for a problem statement X, then no code will be accepted for the same problem statement X (in that language), until and unless you solve it with a different approach (in which case you need to explicity mention in the filename eg. Inorder_Using_Iteration.cpp )
